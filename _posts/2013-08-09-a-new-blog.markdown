Hello everyone !

This is the first post of a -I hope- a long serie of originals and inspirings posts on this blog. More will come about who I am, what I do and how this blog is built.

This blog is hosted on my server but all the source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/geekuillaume/Geekuillaume-Blog/). Don't hesitate to see how it work by diging inside the source code.

Stay tuned !
